VCL
vibe code language

i asked grok what he might want to do to create a truly pythonic streamlined syntax that would provide  a more AI conducive set of commands that could become something like a Kotlin to Java but in python. the next thing is that this would solve the compiling at the time of running issue with "transpiling" the code is "compiled " when it is saved and only when the code runs without error will it be considered reasy for production. giving it a layed designation that prevents the client from running code thats not ready to be used!
